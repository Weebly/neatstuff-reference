# NeatStuff's ORM (NORM)

As the docblock in `Model\Base` regretfully informs you, we've accidentally created our own ORM for the NeatStuff application.
This is a document explaining the basics behind what it does, what it doesn't do, why it's awful, and so on.

Let's get started.

 * Things NORM generally supports:
   * SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE
   * 

 * Things NORM does not support:
   * Multiple models, CRUD options on multiple models
   * Transactions (:thumbsup:)
